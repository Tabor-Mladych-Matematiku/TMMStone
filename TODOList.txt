TODO:
	Priority:
		EndGame
		EditorExt
		Make at least one deck with the EditorExt
		Ask about the plugin
		Do Adressables at the end

	-------Less Important:

	BattleCry - after placing a battlecry minion attach a fake cardlike thing to the cursor that will onclick either finish the op or cancel it.
		Will probably have to add a check to not highlight anything when we have something in the cursor.
	Spells - Make it so that you can undo casting nontargetted spell. (Probably a box around your side of the screen or distance from original spot)

	Export json from website
	Import json in lobby selection
		Display Deck Class in Lobby
		Probably make a deck folder with JSONs
		List them in Lobby selection and allow the selection of one.


Things to polish:
	- Network:
		Loading screens and such - hide the network accesses.
		"Your opponent left"
	- Cards: 
		OnMouseOver they show themselves Properly over whole screen.
		Make em move nicely - sortoff follow mouse in a cool way not instant snap.
	- Prettier Menu
	- LobbyUI:
		Lobby musí mít jméno, nesmí v něm být cizí znaky
		Loading screeny - schovat Loadující se scénu


Notes:
I think there are cases in which "highlighted slot" and "highlightedActor" may keep wrong data - fix?
(They null themselves on leaving the mouse. But that may not be enough)
